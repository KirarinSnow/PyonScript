===PyonScript===


The PyonScript programming language is a Lisp-like language
with a minimal syntax and a stack. It is an extension of the
PostScript programming language and is implemented in PostScript.

The PyonScript interpreter requires GPL GhostScript to run.
It has been tested on GPL GhostScript 8.70 and 8.71 but may not
work on earlier versions.



==Build==

On Unix-like systems, you may use the provided build script.
To build, run the build.sh script:

   $ sh build.sh

This assembles a "pyon.ps" file containing the source code for
the PyonScript interpreter as well as a shell script named
"pyon".

To run the PyonScript interpreter on one or more PyonScript
source files in sequence, specify the filenames of the programs
as arguments:

   $ pyon file1.pyon [file2.pyon ...]

To run PyonScript in interactive mode, simply run "pyon" without
arguments:

   $ pyon



==Install==

On Unix-like systems, you may install PyonScript by running the
install.sh script:

   $ sudo sh install.sh

This installs "pyon" and "pyon.ps" in the /usr/bin/ directory.


==Other Systems==

It is possible to run PyonScript directly through GhostScript
without building and installing. This option may be best for
non-Unix-like systems.

To do so, run GhostScript on the command line with the following
arguments for interactive mode:

   $ gs -q -dNODISPLAY src/library.ps src/interpreter.ps

To run one or more PyonScript programs:

   $ gs -q -dNODISPLAY src/library.ps -- src/interpreter.ps file.pyon [file2.pyon ...]
