==PyonScript==

To run a PyonScript program, run pyon.ps in GhostScript
and give it the filename of a PyonScript program. If more
than one file is provided, the programs will be executed
in sequence.

   $ gs -q -dNODISPLAY -- pyon.ps file1.pyon file2.pyon

To run PyonScript interactively through the GhostScript
shell:

   $ gs -q -dNODISPLAY pyon.ps

This enters the GhostScript shell. You can then evaluate
individual PyonScript objects using the "pyon" operator:

   GS> (= (add 2 3)) pyon
   5

A native PyonScript shell is in development.
