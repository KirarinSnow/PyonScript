==PyonScript==




==Run==

To install, see the "Install" section below. The following
instructions are for running PyonScript without installing.

To run a PyonScript program, run pyon.ps in GhostScript
and give it the filename of a PyonScript program. If more
than one file is provided, the programs will be executed
in sequence.

   $ gs -q -dNODISPLAY -- pyon.ps file1.pyon [file2.pyon ...]

To run PyonScript interactively:

   $ gs -q -dNODISPLAY pyon.ps



==Install==

To build and install, run the install.sh script:

   $ sudo sh install.sh

This builds a script named "pyon" and installs it in the
/usr/bin/ directory. To run:

   $ pyon file1.pyon [file2.pyon ...]
