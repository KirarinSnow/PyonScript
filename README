==PyonScript==




==Build==

To build, run the build.sh script:

   $ sh build.sh

This assembles a "pyon.ps" file containing the source code for
the PyonScript interpreter as well as a shell script named
"pyon".

To run the PyonScript interpreter on one or more PyonScript
source files in sequence, specify the filenames of the programs
as arguments:

   $ pyon file1.pyon [file2.pyon ...]

To run PyonScript in interactive mode, simply run "pyon" without
arguments:

   $ pyon



==Install==

To install, run the install.sh script:

   $ sudo sh install.sh

This installs "pyon" and "pyon.ps" in the /usr/bin/ directory.
